# 10-Steps
A variant of an academic project put forth by Professor Edwin Rodriguez of Cal Poly Pomona, this is a console baseed RPG where you control (insert your hero/heroine's name here) and attempt to escape a trap they found themselves inside a cave. 

Armed with one of three weapons chosen by the player at the start of the game, the hero/heroine is 10 steps away from the cave, and freedom. Every step they take however, there is a chance to encounter a thug (unarmed or armed with a randomly chosen weapon). You may try to fight, take a step back, or attempt to escape (Pokemon style). Don't forget your power ups either, an extra magazine and a health pack may come in handy! 

No matter what, one thing is for certain however, it'll be the most difficult 10 steps you ever take.

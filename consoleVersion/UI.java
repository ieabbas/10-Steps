/*
 * A variant of an academic project put forth by Professor Edwin Rodriguez of Cal Poly Pomona, this is a 
 * console baseed RPG where you control(insert your hero/heroine's name here) and attempt to escape a 
 * trap they found themselves inside a cave. Armed with one of three weapons chosen by the player at the start of 
 * the game, the hero/heroine is 10 steps away from the cave, and freedom. Every step they take however, there is 
 * a chance to encounter a thug(unarmed or armed with a randomly chosen weapon). You may try to fight, take a step
 * back, or attempt to escape (Pokemon style). Don't forget your power ups either, an extra magazine 
 * and a health pack may come in handy! No matter what, one thing is for certain however, it'll be the most 
 * difficult 10 steps you ever take.
